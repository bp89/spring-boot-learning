Spring-boot Tutorial
---

This tutorial is structured using branches. For each feature we have created a branch.
Inside each branch we have `README.md` file which contains :

1. Detailed explanation of each feature.
2. Links / References to each feature.

We recommend that you practice each of the example by yourself. This will help you learn
more. Also, in case we have done some mistake or something is needing improvement can be identified.

Last but not least we kept each tutorial very-very simple but detailed.

Below is the list of branches:
